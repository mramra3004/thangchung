# Design Modern Distributed System
- Contract
  - CRQS
    - Command
      - Modify system state
      - Usually need to be handled via Durable communication
      - Must be idempodent - f(x) = f(f(x))
    - Query
      - Don't modify system state
      - Can be handled via any communication type, but often best on Transient
      - Automatically Idempodent because they don't change state
- Communication
  - Communication styles
    - Transient (non durable solution)
      - HTTP
      - TCP
      - UDP
    - Queued
      - RabbitMQ
      - AMQP
      - ActiveMQ
      - AmazonMQ
    - Streamed
      - Kafka
      - Event Store
    - Historic
      - Jinaga
      - GIT
- Coordination
  - Imperative Consumers
    - One handler to receive the message and store it to database
  - Workflows
    - System A, system B, and system C colloboration (no state)
  - State machines
    - DSL with state (MassTransit - Sagas)
- Compensation
  - Exception management
  - Routing Slip pattern
- Correlation
  - Logs - centralized logs
  - Tracing (what have been going on)
  - Distributed tracing on message broker or stream system
